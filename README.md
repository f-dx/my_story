# My story (gangstalking, RNM, targeted individual)

Writing this in 2025, I can summarize that my experience involves engineered tortures by HiveMind society designed specifically to suppress my will for easy onboarding to HiveMind society. But in the process, I found myself stronger than them, so I decided to fight back and organize a neural security business, neural laws protection activism organization, write a few books, connect with ALL opponents of gangstalking, and do my best to stop the "targeted individuals" and "gangstalking" phenomena by taking massive action.


This is my message to gangstalkers: "I am confident that your cruel, barbaric acts of covert violence will be punished by laws. 'Never Again' - this phrase can be applied directly to my case. I will spend every breath of this life dedicated to my fight for justice and to stop worldwide tortures of innocent people like me by your organization of organized cowards, liars, and sociopaths. I encourage you to show your courage and be a whistleblower against high-tech fascism of the 21st century. Don't let the corrupt elites dictate how we should live and what we should do. Free yourself and live your own independent, happy life with good karma - this is my wish for you."
